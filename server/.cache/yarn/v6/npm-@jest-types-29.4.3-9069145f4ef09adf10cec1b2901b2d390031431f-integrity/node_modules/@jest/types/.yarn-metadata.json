Note that this is a third party library maintained at [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/jest) and may not cover the latest Jest features.\n\nAnother use-case for `@types/jest` is a typed Jest config as those types are not provided by Jest out of the box:\n\n```ts\n// jest.config.ts\nimport {Config} from '@jest/types';\n\nconst config: Config.InitialOptions = {\n  // some typed config\n};\n\nexport default config;\n```\n",
